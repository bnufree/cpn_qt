<strong>Make sure your GPS is not being used by some other program!!!!</strong>
Only one program can at one time use the connection. when your GPS program is using the GPS, Opencpn will not be able to do the same. Please quit all other programs using the same connection.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Make sure your GPS is set to output positions using the WGS 84 Geodetic Datum.</strong> This is less of an issue nowadays, compared to, say 10 - 15 years ago.<br/>

Some units can&#039;t be changed, and is permanently set to WGS 84. The BU-353 is one of those.

<p>
Windows 10 users generally must purchase a new GPS Puck specifically configured for Windows 10. For Example, the BU-353 which works with earlier versions of Windows does not work without an elaborate work around involving preventing automatic update of Prolific USB drivers by the <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. It is far easier and more reliable to simply purchase another Windows 10 compatible GPS Puck (similar to the BU-353 S4) and use the associated drivers.<br/>

<p>
Note that the extensive use of the cheap gps mouse BU-353 as an example below, should only be seen as an illustration.
<br/>

To use OpenCPN with a GPS, a GPS receiver is needed.
</p>

<p>
There are a variety of possible choices for a GPS receiver:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A computer, such as a Sony Vaio P has a built in GPS receiver</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A NMEA Expander to amplify a nmea stream to multiple listeners</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A hand-held GPS receiver</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A dedicated GPS receiver</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The remainder of this section describes using OpenCPN with a dedicated GPS receiver, however, the instructions for a dedicated receiver will be similar for any serial/USB connected NMEA data stream.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="a_dedicated_gps_receiver">A Dedicated GPS Receiver</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
There are several companies making dedicated GPS receivers. The Supplementary Hardware section for GPS devices lists several manufacturers.
</p>

<p>
NMEA has traditionally been implemented as a serial protocol and therefore, even if a USB connection is used, there needs to be a USB to Serial Port conversion. The specific driver for the each GPS receiver will handle this conversion.
</p>

</div>

<p>
There is a small LED located on the BU-353. If the LED is off there is no power being received. Check the connection.
</p>

<p>
If the LED is solid it indicates the BU-353 is searching for a GPS signal. Try moving the GPS receiver to a clear location.
</p>

<p>
If the LED is flashing it indicates the BU-353 has a position fix and is transmitting data.

<p>
If you change the USB port for the GPS receiver Prolific will reassign the COM port number. This will require repeating steps 4-12 above. If you are having trouble with Prolific drivers and an Error Code, try reading this page <a href="http://www.ifamilysoftware.com/news37.html" class="urlextern" title="http://www.ifamilysoftware.com/news37.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ifamilysoftware.com/news37.html</a>
</p>

<p>
On some computer / GPS receiver combinations when the computer resumes from Stand By the GPS receiver will no longer transmit its NMEA data stream, and only garbage instead of <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> characters will be visible in the NMEA Data Stream Window. The red indicator led will not work. <br/>
 <br/>
To change back to NMEA mode search for and download SIRFDemo.exe. <br/>
Unpack and start. Set correct Baud rate and and com port as above. <br/>
Click connect to data source button. Action → Switch to NMEA protocol, then exit. <br/>
There are many more settings available in SIRFDemo.exe
</p>

<p>

To proceed, the “<strong>user</strong>” you use on your computer must belong to a <strong>group</strong> that is allowed to open <strong>serial connections</strong>. This group is normally “<strong>dialout</strong>” on Debian based Linuxes, including Ubuntu, and “<strong>uucp</strong>” on Red Hat based distributions. Read more in <em><a href="../options_setting/connections.html#linux_serial_connections" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:options_setting:connections">Connections for Linux</a></em>. <br/>
Check your status by writing “groups” on a command line. The response will be all groups that the user belongs to. Make sure that “dialout” or “uucp” is included. If not, you have to add your user to this group. There are many ways to do this, one is to issue this command: <br/>
“sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER”. Logout of your current session for group changes to take effect. <br/>
This applies to many Debian based distributions, for other distros just drop the sudo and do the command as root, using “su”. <br/>
All major Linux distribution includes a graphical user settings dialog, where adding a user to a group, could be fixed.

<p>
If you have a bluetooth GPS you will need to first configure it through the standard Ubuntu Bluetooth “set up new device ” proceedure. Once you have done that you will need to find what the address of the GPS is. To do that you run this command:   
</p>
<pre class="code">&quot;sudo hcitool scan&quot; </pre>

<p>
it will then start looking for the Bluetooth GPS and hopefully find your GPS. You should see something similar to: 
</p>
<pre class="code">Scanning …
00:1C:88:10:D3:4D    iBT-GPS </pre>

<p>
In this case I have a IBT-GPS at address 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D (Your GPS address will be different)
</p>

<p>
Next we have to bind the GPS address to a “virtual” device OpenCPN understands in this case rfcomm0. We do this with the following command: 
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D </pre>

<p>
Note put your GPS address in this line
You should not have to run these commands each time your linux is restarted as it will remember your GPS address. 
</p>

<p>
Now all you need to do is go into OpenCPN Toolbox and select GPS. 
Now in the NMEA Data Source options select from the pulldown menu: 
“<strong>/dev/rfcomm0</strong>”, or write it in the box, if not present as an alternative. 
</p>

<p>
That&#039;s it - you should now have a Bluetooth GPS Connected.

Your bluetooth GPS should now be working in open CPN. 
Run 
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo opencpn</pre>

<p>
To check that it works (/dev/rfcomm0 under GPS NMEA data source). If it works, try running opencpn without sudo, chances are that you cannot see the gps. if this is the case, use the following fix: 
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER &#039;&#039;</pre>

Run 
</p>
<pre class="code">hcitool scan</pre>

<p>
to get the ID of your bluetooth gps device.
Make a file “rfcomm.config” and put it in /etc/bluetooth.

This file is already present in Ubuntu, but needs editing for persistent connection.

Change XX:XX:XX…. to your device ID
Open Opencpn and write <strong>/dev/rfcomm0</strong> as GPS NMEA device. Note that you can add it yourself by writing directly into the scroll down box. 
Permissions for <strong>/dev/rfcomm0</strong> are for group “<strong>dialou</strong>t”. Make sure you belong to that group. 
The command “groups” will show all the groups you belong to. 
Make sure that “gpsd” isn&#039;t running, issuing “killall gpsd” as root.

<p>
Attaching a GPS device to a Mac is done via one of the USB ports. Whether using a device with its own USB lead or via a serial-USB adapter lead or an NMEA multiplexer with USB port, the appropriate <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> X driver needs to be installed. Nearly all hardware uses one of just two chip makes: those from FTDI or Prolific. Both those companies make <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> X drivers available on their web sites, but manufacturers of GPS devices usually package the driver with device. 
</p>

<p>
When the driver is installed and the device connected, start OpenCPN, select the Toolbox and click the GPS tab. Open the “NMEA Data Source” menu &amp; select the the device from the list. It is not always obvious which is the correct one, but in general the device will have a name starting: ”/dev/cu.“ or ”/dev/tty.“. Some manufacturers make it obvious, like ”/dev/cu.MiniPlex-99000125“, but others may be more generic, like: ”/dev/cu.usbserial“. Set the “NMEA Baud Rate” to 4800 and click “OK”. If the correct selection has been made, you should see the GPS status icon change from red to green.

<p>
Use of Virtualized Environments such as Parallels, VM, VirtualBox, etc to run an alternative version of Opencpn on your Mac or PC are beyond the scope of this section. However experienced users are invited to report the specifics about using USB ports with Virtual Configurations. Please be specific about the setup and software and explain how virtual USB ports work in that environment. These commenta will eventually make their way into this section. 
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that each Virtual Software handles virtualization of USB and Sharing differently. This can affect the connection and reliability of the connection for GPS.  
</p>

<p>
OpenCPN is user powered, so we depend on User&#039;s sharing their experiences. Please assist us.
