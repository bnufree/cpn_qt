A layer is persistent and protected from changes. A waypoint in a gpx file for example, can be imported either as a “waypoint” or as a layer. The difference is that when imported as a layer it cannot be changed or deleted.</div>

It can for example be used to update charts with new navigation marks and dangers as per Notices to Mariners, and to add Radio Call-In Points or to build a database of lights and locations, that will be visible on chart regardless of current scale. See the first picture above, where French and UK forecast areas are good examples of Layers. In the second picture, a very good celestial fix, plotted with a gpx script has been saved as a layer.</div>

This can be used for developing layers, or for import from a user defined directory with predefined layers, as necessary. Layers imported this way will be saved when closing down the computer, they are persistent. More permanent layers should be kept in the “layers” directory, as described above.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Delete: </strong>Unloads the layer, but doesn&#039;t of course touch the originally imported gpx file. A progress bar will appear when deleting large layers. It is not possible to stop the deletion, once started. For size restrictions, see below.</div>

The same thing can be achieved by clicking the “eye” to the left of the layers name. A red X across the eye marks a hidden layer. See picture above. These settings are persistent, they will be remembered after a restart.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Hide WPT Names</strong>  Shows a visible layer without waypoint names. This helps to un-clutter layers, when zoomed out.</div>

Just save the gpxfile in the right place, described above. Note that “visible” in this context is the opposite to a layer, route or waypoint being “hidden”. This means that objects not visible on the screen, may be included.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> OpenCPN is  not suited to handle very large permanent layer files. Exporting and deleting such layers bogs down the program. With older hardware or limited available memory, even these recommendations may be to optimistic.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> OpenCPN 4.0 has refined the track and layer logic to improve performance with large tracks. See next paragraph.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Newly developed static layers by <a href="http://argus.survice.com/argus_datadownload.asp" class="urlextern" title="http://argus.survice.com/argus_datadownload.asp" rel="nofollow">argus.survice.com</a> show that OpenCPN has problems with very large layers consisting of waypoints named after the depth at the position. With 10,000 + posistions it&#039;s necessary to consider some rules when using OpenCPN. If you disregard these rules, expect bad performance.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Deactivating OpenGL may improve the performance somewhat.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Always load the files as a temporary layer, zoomed in on your local area. Never load when zoomed out. Why? Zoomed out OpenCPN has to handle all wpts at the same time when zooming/panning. Zoomed in it just a handful of wpts at the same time.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> An alternative is to load a file when zoomed in on an other area. This goes quick. Then promptly make the layer invisible. Only make the layer visible when zoomed in on the actual area.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Never zoom out with these files loaded, unless you make the layer invisible first. There is no point in this anyway as all you will see is a lot of black “smear”.</div>
