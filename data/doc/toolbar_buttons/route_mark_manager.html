Navigation objects in OpenCPN, except for “Temporary layers”, are persistent between OpenCPN sessions.  <a href="../advanced_features/navigation_data_backup.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:advanced_features:navigation_data_backup">Navigation Data Backup</a> discusses data persistence more fully.

<p>
You can toggle the visibility of active objects by clicking the “eye” <img src="../opencpn/manual/eye33.h.18_tok.7aec0e_w.24.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="24" height="18" /> to the left of the object name on each line. For waypoints the eye is replaced by the icon shown on the chart for the waypoint.  A red X across the “eye” (or waypoint icon) means that the object is invisible.

</div>

<h4 id="sort_by_columns">Sort by Columns</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Objects can be sorted by their column header in the Route &amp; Mark Manager. For example, clicking “Route Name” will cause the routes below to be sorted alphabetically.  Clicking again reverses the order.

<h4 id="selection_by_ctl_-_left-click">Selection by Ctl - Left-click</h4>
<div class="level4">

You can select multiple objects in the Routes, Tracks, or Waypoints tabs by holding down the CTRL key and left-clicking the objects or by holding the SHIFT key and selecting the first and last object of a group.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="properties_by_double_click">Properties by Double Click</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Double-clicking on a route, track, or waypoint brings up its Properties dialog.  It&#039;s a shortcut for selecting the object and clicking the Properties button.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="export_import_gpx_files">Export &amp; Import GPX Files</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
You can export and import routes, tracks, waypoints, and layers using the GPX transfer format. This lets you save your routes and marks to external files so you can have more than the active ones - for example, to do route planning or archive existing data.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> GPX format is supported by a wide variety of programs.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You can have as many external files as you wish, there are no limits on the number of eternal files.</div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Prepare layers as an aid to navigation en route.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Keeping a lot of active routes in OpenCPN makes for a cluttered chart display.  It also slows the program and makes it use more system resources.  Imagine a word processor where every document you ever created was displayed unless you made it invisible.  The “Export selected” and “Import GPX” buttons work like the “Save” and “Load” options in most programs.  Just as you wouldn&#039;t save all your word processing documents in a single giant file, it&#039;s not efficient to export all your navigation objects into a single file.
</p>

<p>
It is more efficient to export each route or track to a separate file.  Click on the object, click on the “Export selected” button, name the file, and navigate to the folder in which you want it saved.  If you save each route and track in its own file you can import them individually.  There is more discussion of a strategy for creating routes at <a href="create_route.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:create_route">Create Route</a>.
</p>

<p>
The “Export All Visible” button is useful for making a quick backup copy of all your navigation objects but the resulting file is cumbersome to work with.  It is also useful for creating a GPX file that is to be loaded as a layer.

A route is a set of two or more points you wish to visit in a given sequence.  Route points can be defined as the route is created or they can be previously defined waypoints or route points.

Tracks can be sorted by clicking the column headers. Tracks are extended backward, based on the time-stamp sequence, a track is selected, which ends as the latest one before the start of current track. Tracks are extended as a single segment if they share the extending point. If they have no common point a new “empty” segment, with no visible track, is added.

Joining two tracks (i.e. extending a track) results in just track one remaining. It may look like two tracks but the Route Manager treats it as a single track.

</p>

<p>
To change a single WP icon of a route go to the properties window with a right click on the WP icon.
To Globally change a Route&#039;s WP Icons is not possible because the icon Diamond is hard coded in the source. 
However it is possible to change globally the WP icon for normal WPs, the triangle.
To do that search a line with “DefaultWPIcon=…” in opencpn.ini.
