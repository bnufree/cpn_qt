OpenCPN makes a serious effort to be compliant with IHO standards for ECDIS display of cartography.
</p>

<p>
Starting with vector charts requires some learning. In some respect they are different than paper/raster charts. This page deals mainly with the specifics of OpenCPN and is <strong>not</strong> a vector-chart tutorial.
</p>

<p>
See David Burch&#039;s book “Electronic Chart Navigation”, and the 2013 (or later) US Chart 1, available from: <a href="https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chart1/ChartNo1.pdf" class="urlextern" title="https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chart1/ChartNo1.pdf" rel="nofollow">US ChartNo1.pdf</a> .
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Note: On the forum there are quite a few questions regarding these chart symbols.

<p>
<strong>First</strong> One very important setting for vector charts is handled directly from the main toolbar. This button toggles all text displayed on a vector chart On and Off. The hotKey “<strong>T</strong>” is an alternative for toggling the text. In OpenGL mode, all text will always be horizontal when using the “Course Up” option.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Second</strong> Double clicking on a vector chart, as long as the cursor hasn&#039;t changed to a green arrow near the edges, brings up an information dialog, displaying the available vector-chart information at the selected point. Scroll down to see all the information. An alternative to double clicking is right-clicking an select “Object Query”. Note that a single normal (left) click will center the chart at that point.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../opencpn/manual/dyngnaset.jpg" class="media" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
The example shown above is the result of double-clicking on a lighthouse in a busy area.
</p>

<p>
Exactly what is shown in this dialog depend on the settings described below in “Display Categories”.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Third</strong> It is possible to select what font is used for the text on vector charts. There is an entry in <em>Options &gt; User Interface &gt; Fonts</em> in the dropdown menu select <strong>ChartTexts</strong>. Here you select what font-face to use, and a template size. Weight and final size of the displayed texts depends on the charts you are using, but if the charts contain various weights and sizes, they will all scale together depending on what size you select.
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Options &gt; Charts &gt; Vector Charts Tab</strong></em> is where everything else is handled.
</p>

<p>
If the S63 chart plugin is active, there will also be a “S63 Charts” tab. </strong></em> .

<div class="level2">

<p>
A general recommendation would be to use the “All” display category or “Mariners Standard” with “Select All” marked , and then switch of certain features as required. As an example let&#039;s look at passing through the British gas fields in the SW North Sea 
<br/>

<img src="../opencpn/manual/europe1.h.415_tok.65838a_w.480.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="480" height="415" />
<br/>

<br/>

This is not easy, so we want to get rid of all those red and yellow circles. <br/>

Double click on one of the platforms, square with a dot. 
<br/>

<br/>

<img src="../opencpn/manual/4objq.tok.45013f_w.500.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="500" />
<br/>

<br/>

At the top it reads “<strong>Light </strong>  (Lights)”, which means that you clicked on a light, which belongs to the Feature Class “Lights”. Find “Light” in the Mariners Standard list of available filters, and uncheck it. 
<br/>

<br/>

<img src="../opencpn/manual/vector-light.h.338_tok.9ce018_w.234.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="234" height="338" />

<br/>

Press the “Apply” button

<br/>

<br/>

Much better In this particular case, there is a shortcut, use the Hot Key “<strong>L</strong>” to toggle all lights on/off. <br/>

Turns the depths on and off. Other settings also affects when soundings are displayed, for example “Reduced Detail at Small Scale”. The bold black numbers are not soundings. Instead they refer to heights of nearby islets or cays. On official paper charts the soundings are printed in italics.

The bold number 20 refers to the land height of the unnamed cay SW of the number. <br/>

Safety Depth is set to 20 m, so the 20 m contour stands out in black. <br/>

<br/>

How soundings behave when zooming. “Chart sounding symbols” are represented by small raster images. As a chart is zoomed in, these raster symbols will increase in size by about 2x. Currently they increase in size well after the “<strong>Overzoom</strong>” notice, for the largest scale chart available. <br/>

Provides information about the chart itself. With this switch on, an object query reveals such information as the buoy system for the area, the <strong>Quality of the Survey</strong>, the latest NTM update and sources for the chart. 
</p>

<p>
On raster-charts there is often a diagram showing the sources and age of surveys of the charts. 
</p>

<p>
On vector-charts, when activated, symbols are shown all over the screen. An object query of these symbols gives the details. When using “Mariners Standard” and “Chart Information Objects” is ticked, it is possible to get rid of the quality symbols covering the chart by unchecking “Quality of data”.

Even when using “Reduced Detail at Small Scale”, there are cases when text labels overlaps or overwrites other labels and creates a cluttered impression. Ticking this box tries to clear the view, dropping overlapping text labels in the interest of legibility. The labels that get dropped are the last that would have been drawn. But, as there is no built-in priority scheme for text labels in ENC vector charts, this setting may hide needed information.

The most important of these three settings, it affects the presentation of depths and dangers. The safety depth directly affects the displayed bold safety contour.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> OpenCPN can only display contours that are already built into the chart. If the safety depth is between two built in contours, the deeper one will be the safety contour, displayed bolder than the other contours. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Depths less than the safety depths will be printed in black, depths greater than this value will be printed in gray. So it is possible to see gray depths inside the safety contour, depending on settings. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> One example of how the safety depth affects the chart display is how isolated dangers, for example a wreck is displayed.</div>

</ul>

<p>
<br/>

<br/>


<br/>

<br/>

The safety contour is 3.6 m and the wreck is marked by the magenta cross, as the wreck is surrounded by safe water but the depths over the wreck is less than the safety depth.

<h4 id="other_settings">Other Settings</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Important as they affect how the different depths are colored.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> They can help you identify a deep channel for example, or they can, in the worst case scenario, prevent you from being aware of a shallow area. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> There is no setting that fits all circumstances. For example a Sea Mount with a depth of 20m in the middle of an ocean should be regarded as “shallow” and be avoided, while 20 m depth in a harbor approach in protected water, probably is safe. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Depth Settings controls the coloring of the water as a function of depth. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> By setting the Safety and Deep water right you will have a visible border to show when to take care about shallow water. <br/>

</ul>

<h4 id="cm93_charts_and_enc">CM93 Charts and ENC</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Work very similar. The charts contain depth area features according to fixed depth cutoff zones, usually 5, 10, and 20 meters.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Intermediate values are not available in the database, if you select a value between those available, OpenCPN chooses the next higher value available for display of color. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The charts are inconsistent in this area, depending on the country issuing the original charts. For example in UK and the Netherlands the depth contours in CM93 are 2, 5 and 10 meter while in US the are based on feet but expressed in meters, such as 3.7, 5.5, 9.1 and 18.3 m.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Generally</strong>  for both ENC and CM93, find these fixed depth cutoffs by double-clicking so the Object Query dialog pops up. The last entry is usually Depth Area. The two values in the range, represents these built in cutoffs. </div>
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
An example from UK with cutoff values of 5m and 10m. <strong>If for example</strong>  as is the case on the South China Sea Hydrographic Commissions charts, the shallowest area has a range “0 m - 10 m”, there is, in most cases, no point in setting “Shallow Depth” to anything but 10 m. Find out these cut off depth for your area and set the “Depth Settings” with this knowledge together with your preferences and activity. <br/>

</p>

<p>
With all the reservations above, the general case for 4 colors, will be described.

<p>
Water deeper than Safety Depth but less than Deep Depth will display a light gray color. The Safety Depth contour is clearly marked with black borderline. Water deeper than Deep Depth is displayed in white. <br/>
<strong>Finally</strong>  a word about <strong>drying heights</strong>, displayed in green. There is no detailed information available for drying heights, neither in CM93 ver2 nor in many ENC charts. Some ENC charts have negative ranges, for example “-2 m - 0 m” in areas with drying heights. This adds very little, as it really only gives the information that the drying height is less than the first value in the range, in an area of unspecified size. <br/>
This situation is changing though. A set of new charts released in april 2012, by the Dutch Authorities, sets a standard for others to follow in this regard. See picture below. Modern Australian S63 charts are equally good. <br/>
<img src="../opencpn/manual/bramb.h.325_tok.4a7778_w.600.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="600" height="325" /><img src="../opencpn/manual/bramb1.h.335_tok.e843bd_w.600.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="600" height="335" /> <br/>
While a raster chart tells us that we need a Height of Tide that is 1.2m + safety margin + the draft of our own vessel. <br/>
<img src="../opencpn/manual/bramb2.h.425_tok.be8f12_w.600.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="600" height="425" /> <br/>
Heights of islands etc. are not available in CM93, while ENC charts, in many cases, have info about heights of summits and some contour lines. Is Balls Pyramid a high Island, that the name implies, or is it named with the same sarcastic humor as “Greenland” ? CM93 can&#039;t tell.

The CM93 charts slider control that allows the user to adjust the screen complexity to suit the actual situation as well as the available processor capability. <br/>
Normal settings depend on a combination of personal preferences and present usage of map. To see more details, the “<strong>CM93 Detail Level</strong>” slider, can be set to a higher positive number or for navigation in shipping lanes to a negative numbers. Typical zoom level 5 is good for fishing when as much details are possible is of interest. Zoom level of +1, zero or -1 is usually fine for normal use. <br/>
Positive values give more detail, but at a cost:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It simply takes longer to render larger scale charts covering more screen real estate.</div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It can become dramatically slower if high detail is specified, and chart outlines are requested. In this case, the program has to read a lot more cells to get their outlines.</div>
