<div class="level3">

</div>

<h4 id="automatic_daily_tracks">Automatic Daily Tracks</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Automatic Daily Tracking ensures that the track-points collected throughout a single day (midnight to midnight in local zone time) are stored and managed as a single (possibly multi-segment) track.
</p>

<p>
If the Automatic Daily Tracking check-box is selected, the “Toggle Tracking” tool will turn tracking on and off. However, on turning it off, the accumulated track will be extended with the previous one if it does not extend into yesterday. Disjoint segments are kept separate, time-adjacent segments are merged into a single segment. Disjointed track segments can be joined through the right-click menu when they are selected in the Route Managers Tracks Tab.
</p>

<p>
Every Midnight the tracking is turned off and on again automatically to ensure that the track does not span dates. If Automatic Daily Tracking is selected during the day, when some tracks have already been created, only the last one will be merged with future daily tracks.
</p>

<p>
Assuming Automatic Daily Tracking is on, normally during tracking periods there will be two tracks visible in the Route Manager: the current track (red color track-points on the chart) and the previously accumulated track for the day. After toggling tracking off there will be just one track for this day.
</p>

<p>
If the timezone needs to be changed, it is a good idea to close OpenCPN application before.
</p>

<p>
With the manual capability of splitting and extending, the daily tracks can be easily managed at any time.
</p>

<p>
The daily tracks will be automatically named with the date in the local Time Zone, but can of course be changed manually.
</p>

<p>
The Automatic Daily Tracks follow the settings in <strong>Tracking Precision</strong>, see below.
</p>

<p>
Without Automatic Daily Tracks selected, OpenCPN handles tracks as before.

<h4 id="highlight_tracks">Highlight Tracks</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Shows a 7 to 10m wide highlighting on either side of the track. This is not selectable for individual tracks. The idea of the highlighting is to remind us that following a previous track exposes us to the inherent inaccuracy of GPS, and that the real track followed is most likely within the highlight region, but not necessarily in the middle. And this says nothing about the accuracy of the underlying cartography. For many charts it is prudent to assume at least 1.5 mm inaccuracy using the nominal scale of the chart. For a chart in scale 1:20,000 this translates to 30m.

<p>
With track button in the ToolBar activated this setting affects the size of the data saved. It also affects the “smoothness” of the track, though this is only visible when zoomed in to a very large scale. OpenCPN uses smart dynamic tracking, and only uses those track points that actually contributes anything to the track. A straight line track for example is only represented by it&#039;s endpoints. This is done by analyzing the track just behind the boat. The process is visible in real time, close to Own Ship. The end result is good track accuracy while keeping the size small.

<p>
Gives an answer to this question. When following a Route with the autopilot engaged at what distance from the upcoming waypoint should OpenCPN tell the autopilot to change to the next waypoint? The default is 0.05 nautical miles. This is equal to about 93 meters or 300 feet. The default setting does not fit all circumstances. A number of factors are involved, for example,
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the type of navigation,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the waypoint selected,</div>
</li>

<p>
<img src="../opencpn/manual/options-ships-ownship-routes.jpg" class="media" alt="" /></a>

The arrival radius can also be set individually for each waypoint in the Waypoint Properties dialog.

<!-- EDIT6 SECTION "Routes" [6364-7094] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit7" id="advance_route_waypoint_on_arrival_only">Advance route waypoint on arrival only</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Routes are explained in <strong><em><a href="../getting_started/marks_and_routes.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:getting_started:marks_and_routes">Marks and Routes</a></em></strong> . With an active route, the Dialog “This Leg” is visible near the upper right corner of the screen. This dialog contains “RNG”, the “actual range”, or distance to the next waypoint. The “normal range” is different. It is the distance from ownship to a line which passes through the destination waypoint and is at right angles to the current route segment. The actual range is always equal to or greater than the normal range. When the difference is greater than 10% both values are shown in “RNG” (Shown in the <strong><em><a href="../toolbar_buttons/create_route.html#active_route_console_window" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:toolbar_buttons:create_route">Active Route Console</a></em></strong> <img src="../opencpn/manual/4rng.jpg" class="media" alt="" /></a>The “normal” range is the second number shown. 1.88 in this case.
When following a Route OpenCPN normally decides to advance to the next waypoint if at least one of the following two conditions apply.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The “normal range” is less than the declared arrival radius.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Own Ship is moving away from the target waypoint, and has been for more than two seconds.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
With <strong>Advance route waypoint on arrival only</strong>  activated, OpenCPN <strong>only</strong>  advances the route to the next waypoint, if condition <strong>1</strong>  above is true. Condition <strong>2</strong>  is ignored.
</p>

<p>
This feature is useful when sailing and you can&#039;t lay the next mark and are forced to tack a few times to reach it. It allows a ship to move away from waypoint without automatically advancing to next waypoint. This ensures that the next waypoint stays active until you either reach it, or you reach a line through it, which is perpendicular to the marked route. In the latter case you have a cross track error greater than the arrival radius.
</p>

<p>
<strong>On the other hand….</strong>  Option 2 helps you if you really want to cut a corner by a large distance in such a way that the “normal range” will never be less than the arrival radius. We want to automatically advance the route in this case.

<p>
Maritime Mobile Service Identifier (MMSI) is a number identifying a ship in communication. MMSI consists of nine digits. All VHF units using Digital Selective Call (DSC), are programmed with the vessels MMSI. The same applies for AIS and EPIRBs.  <a href="https://www.milltechmarine.com/about-mmsi_ep_69.html" class="urlextern" title="https://www.milltechmarine.com/about-mmsi_ep_69.html" rel="nofollow">For more about MMSI from Miltech</a>
</p>

<p>
MMSI numbers, individual targets, can be handled in a few preset ways. Below we have set 970000099 as an MMSI that should be tracked as a MOB. The number could for example belong to a crew member&#039;s Personal Locator Beacon.
</p>

<p>
Several MMSI IDs below are set to never show their tracks. This can be used on frequent targets in your neighborhood, like ferries etc. The MMSI 219000368 is set to never be shown. Be aware that neither this target nor its track will ever be seen on your screen.
</p>

<p>
The MMSI 219010183 is set as “Follower”. This is a buddy and no AIS Alert is shown. The “MMSI Properties” popup becomes available when right-clicking. Doubleclicking on the MMSI bypasses the popup an takes you directly to the Properties edit dialog.

With this setting a MOB from your ownship will be signalled immediately. Special Search and Rescue Transponders, SARTs, are now available, using the AIS system. Personal Locator Beacons transmitting on the AIS frequencies are also available. These are sometimes called Personal AIS MOB Devices. Don&#039;t confuse these with the more common personal EPIRB, that cannot be tracked by OpenCPN.
</p>

<p>
Entering the the MMSI number makes it possible to use these devices as an onboard emergency MOB tracking system. Setting off a device alarms all vessels that can receive the signal but it tells you that this emergency is directly related to your vessel. OpenCPN will now treat this MMSI as a standard MOB.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AIVDO NMEA 0183 sentence → AIS position reports from own vessel</div>

</ul>

<p>
The setting is intended for the following very specific scenario:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You have an AIS transponder, not connected to your computer.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You have a separate AIS receiver, used to monitor your own AIS signal, as well as all other traffic.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You desire not to collide with yourself, virtually.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So you instruct O to convert the AIVDM for your MMSI coming in via your AIS receiver into AIVDO, or Own Ship. Thus, no collision.
</p>

<p>
The option is also handy to clear a non-sense “ownship” AIS icon from the screen when the AIS transponder is misconfigured.
