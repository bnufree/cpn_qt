</p>

<p>
Variation will be calculated at Own Ship&#039;s position, if possible. AIS targets however, will use the targets position for variation, if possible.

<h4 id="suppress_blurfog_effect_on_overzoom">Suppress blur/fog effect on overzoom</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Charts are commonly based on surveys that are twice the scale of the charts natural scale. For example a chart in 1:50,000 would be based in a survey in 1:25,000. Once a vector chart is zoomed in to a factor 2, the data do not support any more details. OpenCPN makes the navigator aware of this fact in a few different ways.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../opencpn/manual/overzoom.tok.fd68b7_w.500.jpg" class="media" alt="" width="500" /></a>
</p>

<p>
This screen-shot shows an example how overzoom warnings are shown.
</p>

<p>
At a zoom factor of 4 the embossed OverZoom warning will be displayed in the NW part of the screen. This applies to vector charts and raster charts using the Mercator projection.
</p>

<p>
From a factor 10 to 30 a blur or gentle bluish fog will be overlaid on vector charts. Overzoom blurring is performed only for those systems with modern and fully capable OpenGL drivers/cards. Otherwise, a very gentle “fog” is applied to extreme overzoom displays, as a visual que to the user that the chart is highly overzoomed. From a factor 10, lines and depth numbers on vector charts will be scaled and appear bigger, to further indicate the imprecision of chart features at high overzoom. This imitates what happens with a raster chart, when the individual pixels gets bigger and bigger.
</p>

<p>
If “Suppress blur/fog effects on overzoom” is selected the blurring or bluish fog, will be turned off.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="suppress_scaled_vector_charts_on_over-zoom">Suppress scaled vector charts on over-zoom</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
If this option is selected the scaling of lines and numbers on vector charts will be turned off.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note that</strong>  the blurring effect and scaled vector charts does not apply to single chart mode, so these effects can be turned off temporarily by toggling the “Q” hotkey.
</p>

<p>
Below is how it looks like with both the above options activated.

<h4 id="chart_rotation_averaging_time">Chart Rotation Averaging Time</h4>

<p>
<strong>Chart Rotation Smoothing</strong>. <em>Course-Up Mode Display Update Period (old title)</em> Controls how often the entire displayed chart is updated when Look Ahead and/or Course-Up mode are activated. The Own Ship and AIS icons are still updated every second. The default value is 15 seconds. A “zero” value is allowed! The default mode is North-up. It&#039;s easy to switch between the two modes through the right-click menu or <a href="../getting_around/display_orientation.html" class="wikilink1" title="opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:getting_around:display_orientation">Display Orientation Icon</a> next to the GPS Status Icon located upper right corner.

<h4 id="chart_zoomscale_weighting">Chart Zoom/Scale Weighting</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
This option has a short description, on screen. Here are some further notes. The slider applies to zoom operation dynamics, not to static chart selection. The option really asks you this question. “On zooming in, when do we switch to a smaller scale chart if available?” Your answer may depend on your screen resolution and other preferences. The slider affects zoom-in operations most directly. Setting the slider to -5 delays switching to smaller scale to improve performance and visibility. Setting the slider to 0 restore the default behavior. Setting the slider to +5 switches sooner to a smaller scale chart to show more detail. It ias not intended that a user exercise this control very often. Maybe experiment, set it to your liking for average charts in your area, and leave it set.

<h4 id="texture_compression_with_caching">Texture Compression with Caching</h4>

<p>
A further improvement to raster chart display loading and panning. This option uses the system hard drive to store pre-calculated raster chart compressed images in a way that is optimized for direct loading into the graphics card. When enabled, the texture cache is created dynamically, as charts are visited in normal navigation. Depending on the OpenGL hardware capabilities, there may be some slight, but noticeable, delay as a chart is accessed the very first time while the textures are created, compressed, and written to disk. Once a particular chart section has been cached, subsequent accesses are very fast. If the OpenGL hardware texture buffer is capable, then rendering on-screen is virtually instantaneous.
