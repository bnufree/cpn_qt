.SH PLUGIN LOADING

Plugin loading depends on that the opencpn main program can locate the
plugin object file and that the plugin can locate it's own data.
.P
On Linux, the main program searches for plugin .so-files in a library
named \fIopencpn/plugins\fR.
By default, this path is searched in ~/.local/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.
The default search path can be overridden by the OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS
environment variable.
.P
On other platforms, all plugin object files lives in a single directory
defined at installation.
.P
A plugin's data directory is a path ending with
\fIopencpn/plugins/<plugin_name>\fR.
On Linux, this is by default searched in
~/local/share:/usr/local/share:/usr/share.
This search path is overridden by XDG_DATA_DIRS as defined by the freedesktop
spec.
Only plugins adapted for this (i. e., using GetPluginDataDir()) handles this
properly.
.P
On other platforms, the plugin data directories always lives in a common
parent defined at installation time.

.SH NOTES

The support for OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS and XDG_DATA_DIRS was introduced in
version TBD. Prior to this, all plugins was loaded from a single directory
and all plugin data directories had a common parent.
